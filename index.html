    <h3>----Decision Making----</h3>
    <p>Q.1 You are given an integer 
        A, denoting the age of a person, and your task is to determine whether he/she is eligible to vote or not. Note: You have to complete isEligible function. No need to take any input</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.1 const isEligible = (a) => {
           if (a>=18) 
           {
           return "Eligible for Voting"
           }
           else {
             return "Not Eligible for Voting"
           }
        };
        </pre>

    <p>Q.2 PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with     various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values X and Y and asks you to find the relation between them.
        The relationships between integers X and Y are as follows: <br>1. If X < Y, it means that X is smaller than Y. <br>2. If X>Y, it means that X is greater than Y. <br>3. If X=Y, it means that X is equal to Y. Note: You have to complete findRelationship function. No need to take any input.</p>
    <p><pre>Ans.2 const findRelation = (x,y) => {
        if (x< y)
        {
        return (x+" is smaller than "+y)
        }
        else if (x>y)
        { 
        return (x+" is greater than "+y)
        }
        else
        {
        return (x+" is equal to "+y)
        }
    };</pre>

    <p>Q.3 Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student: <br>
        1. If M ≤ 10, the grade will be E. <br>
        2. If 11 ≥ M ≤ 20, the grade will be D. <br>
        3. If 21 ≥ M ≤ 30, the grade will be C. <br>
        4. If 31 ≥ M ≤ 40 , the grade will be B. <br>
        5. If 41 ≥ M ≤ 50, the grade will be A. <br>
        Your friend will enter his marks out of 50, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement. Note: You have to complete findGrades function. No need to take any input.</p>
